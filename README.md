# Impact_of_image_filters_in_facial_detection

Research Focus:
The study aimed to investigate how different filters impact the accuracy of face detection using various classification algorithms.Comparison of algorithms: Six different algorithms were used: CNN, Random Forest, SVM, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, KNN, and Logistic Regression.

Datasets:

Unfiltered dataset: 1600 images of eight students (200 images each).
Filtered dataset: 8000 images of eight students (1000 images each), using a mix of five filters (blur, cut-out, mosaic, noise, and shear).
Individual filtered datasets: Five additional datasets, each created using a single filter.

Findings:
1-Overall impact of filters: The overall impact of filters on face detection accuracy was minimal.
2-Specific filter effects: The "blur" filter showed a significant difference in results compared to the unfiltered dataset, while other filters had no significant effect.
3-Algorithm-specific results: KNN and CNN showed slight improvements in accuracy with the filtered dataset, while other algorithms experienced a slight decline.
